benim istedigim proje: Act as a Senior Django Architect and DevOps Engineer. We are building a "Mini-ITSM Platform" called "PyService" that mimics the core functionality of ServiceNow but using Python/Django.

The goal is to build an ITIL-compliant system to be used as a portfolio project, demonstrating knowledge of CMDB, SLAs, and Workflows.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Assume local setup for now, provide models compatible with Postgres)
- **API:** Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5 (Responsive, clean enterprise look)
- **Task Queue (Optional but planned):** Celery (Keep architecture ready for this)

### Core Modules & Requirements

1. **CMDB (Asset Management) Module**
   - **Models:** `Department`, `User` (extend AbstractUser), `Asset` (Laptop, Monitor, etc.).
   - **Relationships:**
     - Users belong to a Department.
     - Assets are assigned to Users (One-to-Many).
     - Assets have status (In Stock, Assigned, Retired, In Repair).
   - **Logic:** When a User is created, if their role is 'Staff', the system should suggest available 'In Stock' assets.

2. **Incident Management Module (ITIL Focused)**
   - **Model:** `Incident`
   - **Fields:** Title, Description, Caller (User FK), Assigned to (IT Staff FK), Impact, Urgency, Priority (Calculated), State (New, In Progress, Resolved, Closed).
   - **SLA Logic:** Add a method or signal that calculates a `due_date` based on Priority.
     - Critical = 4 hours
     - High = 24 hours
     - Low = 48 hours.

3. **Service Request Module (Workflow Focused)**
   - **Model:** `ServiceRequest` (e.g., Request for new software).
   - **Workflow:**
     - State starts at 'Draft'.
     - When submitted -> State becomes 'Awaiting Approval'.
     - If Manager approves -> State becomes 'Assigned' (Sent to IT).
     - If Rejected -> State becomes 'Closed/Skipped'.

4. **API (Integration)**
   - Create `serializers.py` and `views.py` using ViewSets for Incident and Asset models.
   - Ensure standard CRUD operations are available via JSON.

### Task for You
Please start by generating the **folder structure** and the **`models.py`** code for these modules.
- Use best practices for field naming (snake_case).
- Use `django.utils.timezone` for dates.
- Add specific methods in the `Incident` model to calculate Priority matrix (Impact + Urgency = Priority) and the SLA deadline.
- Add comments explaining the "ITIL logic" in the code (e.g., "Calculating SLA based on priority").

After the models, please provide the **`admin.py`** configuration to manage these easily.
